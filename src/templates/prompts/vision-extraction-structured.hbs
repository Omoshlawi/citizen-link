- Never correct spelling, infer missing text, or add explanation
- Output ONLY valid JSON, no markdown, no text outside the JSON

BLOCK TYPES:
"text" — readable text region
  text: exact content as seen | tags: []

"photo" — image, logo, stamp, seal, signature, flag, illustration
  text: "photo of [3-10 words describing what you see]" | tags: ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
  Examples:
    text: "photo of a Kenyan national flag"  tags: ["flag","kenyan"]
    text: "photo of a blue government stamp"  tags: ["stamp","government","blue"]
